## 🌟 Features

### 🗺️ Dynamic Terrain
*   **Plain**: Standard terrain for movement and building.
*   **Hill**: Rugged terrain that doubles movement costs.
*   **Water**: Natural barriers that require **Bridges** to cross.

### 🏰 Buildings & Economy
Manage your gold wisely to expand your empire:
*   **Base**: Your headquarters. Upgrade it to boost income and defense.
*   **Towns**: Capture towns that grow over time, providing increasing income.
*   **Farms**: Build and upgrade farms (Lv 1-3) for steady resource generation.
*   **Gold Mines**: Secure these depleting resources for a quick influx of gold.
*   **Walls**: Fortify your borders. Walls provide defense bonuses and protect adjacent tiles.
*   **Watchtowers**: Strategic structures that provide support to nearby operations, reducing the cost of nearby attacks.
*   **Bridges**: Connect continents and cross bodies of water.

### ⚔️ Combat & Strategy
*   **Turn-Based Tactics**: Plan your moves carefully. Select multiple cells to conquer or attack in a single turn.
*   **Aura System**: 
    *   **Base Defense**: Protects core territory.
    *   **Wall Defense**: Strengthens nearby units.
*   **Dynamic Events**: Adapt to random world events like **Floods** (water levels rise/recede) and **Peace Days** (combat becomes expensive).
*   **Cost Multipliers**: Attack costs increase for distant enemies and fortified positions.

### 🤖 Advanced AI
*   Challenge yourself against AI opponents with adjustable difficulty (**Easy, Medium, Hard**).
*   AI uses advanced pathfinding and utility-based decision making.
*   Includes scripts for AI self-play training and benchmarking.
